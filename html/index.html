<p><em>The Robotics Book</em></p><p> is a premier, freely accessible textbook written to advance education</p><p>in the fundamental concepts of robotics engineering.  The text reviews methods of sensing,</p><p>control, decision-making, and acutation in robotic systems.  It also also explores new</p><p>horizons in the field of robotics, and we hope it inspires in the reader a deep love and</p><p>appreciation for the big, beautiful, crazy world of robotics!</p>

<h2>Publication</h2>

<p><em>The Robotics Book, First Edition</em></p><p> will be published on <strong>Monday, January 5, 2026</strong>.  Later</p><p>editions are planned and will be published irregularly as they are completed.</p>

<p>The text will be available digitally on this website.  In pursuit of <em>The Robotics Book</em>'s</p><p>mission to make high-quality robotics education more accessible to everybody, and to spread</p><p>far and wide a passion for robotics, the digital version of <em>The Robotics Book</em> will be</p><p>available <strong>publicly, at no cost</strong>.  No reader will be asked to create an account or pay</p><p>for access to the book.</p>

<p>For those interested, <em>The Robotics Book</em> will also be available in paperback.  This edition</p><p>will be for purchase, due to the cost of paper, ink, and binding.  However, the cost of the</p><p>paperback edition will be <em>only the cost of materials, printing, binding, and shipping</em>, as</p><p>necessary.</p>

<h2>Authors and Editors</h2>

<p>Currently, <a href="mailto:joseph@theroboticsbook.com">Joseph Hobbs</a> is our only author.  As we</p><p>prepare the manuscript for publication, we will assemble a fantastic team of editors who</p><p>will ensure the text is to the highest standards of quality.  When the manuscript is</p><p>released, these editors will be attributed here.</p>

<h2>Generative AI Statement</h2>

<p>In light of the changing social and technological landscape associated with the advancements</p><p>and widespread usage of generative AI technologies, a statement on generative AI is printed on the</p><p>dedication page of <em>The Robotics Book</em>, inside the front cover.  We reproduce this statement here.</p>

<p>We respect the efforts of the many inspired engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists</p><p>who are currently advancing the state of the art in generative models for language and vision.</p><p>At the same time, we (collectively, everybody whose efforts contributed to the publication of
this book) hold ourselves to the highest standard of quality and accountability in the production</p><p>of educational materials.  Thus, it is both our decision and our guarantee that generative models</p><p>are not used for creating, revising, copyediting, or proofreading any content, written or otherwise,</p><p>in this text.</p></body>
